Holla guys,

This is a simple demo application for generating a test paper pdf by selecting some random questions from the database. It exploits express at back end and jquery mobile for end users with mongo as a database.

h3. Rest API :

bc. GET / : Renders the index page

bc. GET /question : Lists all the questions present in database

bc. POST /question : Persists a question record into database

bc. PUT /question/{id} : Updates a question record into database

bc. DELETE /question/{id} : Deletes a question record from database

bc. GET /question/list : Returns json representation of all the questions which can be further used as per requirements

bc. GET /question/{id} : Returns json representation of a single question

bc. GET /generate : Generates a pdf in the root directory by randomly selecting a set of questions

Exmong is currently an initial alpha release (exmong-0.0.RC1) and is open for community contributions. Issues and Pull requests are most welcome. It's a NODE CRUD application with jquery mobile UI for adding questions to a mongo question bank. It can also be used for async pdf test file generation with random questions from the question bank.

h2. Run

bc. :~$ cd exmong
:~/exmong$ npm install
:~/exmong$ node app.js

bc. browse to http://localhost:3000
